        The Electronic Engineering outreach room, on the fourth floor AC
        building on the University of Surrey campus. (Also see
        [this campus map](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/files/pdf/campusmap.pdf) and
        these [travel directions](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/about/visitors/travel/).)

        Once on the campus, the easiest route is to go to the University
        Library, exit towards the AC building, cross the bridge into the AC
        building, go up one flight of stairs and take the door on your right.
        The room is in that corridor.
